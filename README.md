# How to professionally say

> A guide for your daily professional interactions.

A simple static website for common phrases we might want to say to your colleagues but want to make it sound more professional.

The data for this is being collected from content created by _[@loewhaley](https://www.instagram.com/loewhaley/)_ on instagram. 

# Disclaimer ‚ùé
Hello reader. If you are coming from [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31224996) or [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ug5ivo/how_to_professionally_say/), firstly I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and suggestions (if any). The intent of the project is not to make you respond in a passive aggressive tone but to show you some alternatives of **how you might feel like saying sometimes** over **how you can reframe it a bit better (in some cases atleast)**

I have gathered the data from a content creator on Instagram ([@loewhaley](https://www.instagram.com/loewhaley/)) and yes of course the credits are mentioned everywhere about this.

Based on the responses there it seems like what I started as fun activity can be something more than I thought.

I'll be looking into the possibilities of improving the content to make it less satire and more appropriate for most of the people out there.

Since it's an open sourced project, you can share your feedbacks and idea improvements [here](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/howtoprofessionallysay/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

At ending note, I would just like to say to anyone who feels this is really good and I'm going to use this word by word, please don't, take this as a grain of salt and not seriously (atleast at this point of time till I better structure the content) and anyone who feels negative about this, I'm sorry you feel that way but don't take this very seriously.
