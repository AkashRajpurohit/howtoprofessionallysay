# Contributing

Firstly, thank you for considering to contribute.

There are two ways you can contribute, one is by adding more such QnA data, currently I am following the content shared by _[@loewhaley](https://www.instagram.com/loewhaley/)_ but if you find additional sources of data then feel free to add them to the existing content.

You can find the data source [here](/content/qna.ts).

Another way to contribute is if you find any bugs, you can report them by creating [issue](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/howtoprofessionallysay/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) or better, fix them and open a pull request.

Other than fixing bugs, I'm open to hear your thoughts on feature additions as well and given the time, would love to work on some additional features which might be helpful to anyone using this.

So go ahead, fork this repo and start contributing üçª
